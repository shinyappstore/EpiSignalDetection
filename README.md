tsSignalDetection is a robust application built upon the foundation of the EpiSignalDetection package, offering distinctive features designed for effective signal detection in time series data. Time series analysis in statistics involves the examination of data points ordered chronologically to identify patterns or trends over time. This application, specifically tailored for detecting potential outbreaks, targets infectious disease surveillance data at both the European Union / European Economic Area and country levels. Developed through a collaboration between the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and Epiconcept, tsSignalDetection serves as a dedicated signal detection tool. Users can import external data and conduct basic signal detection analyses, contributing to the overarching capabilities of the EpiSignalDetection package. EpiSignalDetection also introduces an automated report tool, generating results in HTML format and presenting them in tables and graphs.
